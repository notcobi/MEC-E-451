\textit{A film crew is shooting a movie and performs a tracking shot, which involves a moving camera that follows a subject. In this case the camera is situated on a wheeled cart, and the crew encounters a small bump on the road which causes the camera to oscillate vertically. The total distance to be travelled by the camera is 40 m, with the length of each section shown below, and the combined mass of the camera and the cart is 210 kg. Assume the cart moves at a constant speed $v$ for the entire duration, and the height of the bump $Y$ is 5 cm.}

In reference to the indicated coordinate $x$, determine the displacement $(x)$ and velocity $\dot{x}$ of the camera at the end of the shot (i.e. at 40 m). Assume that the stiffness $k$ corresponds to the answer in part (a).}
