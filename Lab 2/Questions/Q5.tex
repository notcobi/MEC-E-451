\textit{If the metal springs were replaced with rubber springs of the same stiffness, would 
you expect the oscillation period to increase or decrease? Why?}

The equation of motion for a damped spring-mass system is given by
\begin{equation*}
    m\ddot{x} + c\dot{x} + kx = 0
\end{equation*}
If $k$ does not change, then the period does not change. However, if the rubber springs have a strong damping effect, then damping ratio $\zeta$ will increase, and hence, period would decrease.
